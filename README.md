The Reliverse community, launched by blefnk Nazar Kornienko, is happy to welcome you to Reliverse Docs!

Relidocs is a documentation website for the Reliverse Community.

‚úíÔ∏è Reliverse Media (aka Reliverse Blog): dev.to‚Äëlike stories from the Reliverse ecosystem and the dev world ‚Äî especially around JS eco. News, insights, and the raw energy of what‚Äôs next.

Reliverse Media is the official blog of [reliverse.org](https://reliverse.org).
It is also a place where users can share their own articles, projects, and ideas.

## Why Reliverse?

Imagine a JS ecosystem where tools feel alive, loyal, and on your side.

We believe that tools should feel like collaborators, not obstacles.  
Reliverse is building a future where flow isn't a luxury ‚Äî it's the default.

Reliverse is a commitment to modernize **how** we build, not just **what** we build.
Our commitment is not just an idea. It's a movement for speed, clarity, and trust.
A universe where devs don't fight their tools, and code feels like flow, not friction.

Happy Reliversing!
