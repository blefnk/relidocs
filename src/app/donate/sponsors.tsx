Thanks for sharing such an insane product with the community! ü¶æ I can see how much work you have put into this project. It is actually insane that one person created this. Much respect to you, bro. I appreciate people like you who share their knowledge and talent with others and ask nothing in return ‚ù§Ô∏è. Unfortunately, many people in this world don't respect the amount of effort and dedication it takes, and they are only interested in how they can benefit from others' work.",
