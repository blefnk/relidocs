        reliverse is a movement to modernize the js ecosystem.
        <br />
        tools that feel alive, loyal, and on your side.
        <br />
        code that flows, not fights.
      </p>
      <p>
        we build for humans and machines—no dark patterns, no fake productivity, just focused
        software that quietly says:
      </p>
      <blockquote className="my-4 border-l-4 border-foreground pl-4 italic">
        hey. we did the thing. you're welcome.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        this isn't about hype or clout. it's about making the boring things fast, safe, and
        invisible. it's about building a universe where you don't have to fight your tools anymore.
      </p>
