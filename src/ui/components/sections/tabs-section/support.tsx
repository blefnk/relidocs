        you're not funding a startup.
        <br />
        you're backing indie infrastructure for a more human js world.
        <br />
        soulful, weird, duct-taped dreams that outlast the shiny stuff.
      </p>
      <h4 className="mt-6 mb-2 text-xl font-bold">why?</h4>
      <p>
        because we give a damn. because we're still human.
        <br />
        and because everything good breaks eventuallyâ€”unless someone keeps showing up to fix it.
