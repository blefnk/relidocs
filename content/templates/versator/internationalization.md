description: This is the internationalization of Versator.

*Stay tuned for further expansions to this section in the future.*

*The instructions below may be outdated, so please double-check them! I will fully update this README.md with the Versator 1.3.0 release.*

Multilingualism at Bleverse Reliverse vision is revered. I adore discussing it and plan to delve into the topic of Next.js 15 App Router internationalization in future writings.

Presently, all languages are machine-translated. Future revisions by native speakers are planned.

useTranslations works both on the server and client; I only need the getTranslations on async components.

*Currently not available.* Use `bun lint:i18n` to verify the i18n files. The tool attempts to rectify issues when possible, offering features like ascending sort. No output means everything is in order.

I'm using *next-intl* for internationalization. Sometime I can use beta/rc versions as needed. Find more information about it [here](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/blog/next-intl-3-0) and [here](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl/pull/149).

## How to add a new language

*The process described below will be simplified and automated in the future. Please let us know if you have any further questions regarding the current process for adding languages.*

1. I will need an [i18n code](https://saimana.com/list-of-country-locale-code/) (in the format `language-country`; the language code alone is sufficient, but it's not optimal for SEO). For example, let's take Chinese, for which I know the codes *zh-cn/zh-tw/zh-hk* are used.
2. Open the `messages` folder and create a `zh-cn.json` file with the example content: `{ "metadata": { "description": "建立更高效、更吸引人且更有利可图的在线商店：使用 Versator" } }`.
3. Now open `src/i18n.ts` and add `"zh-cn": zh_cn` with the appropriate `import` at the top.
4. In the file `src/navigation.ts`, add the corresponding values to `locales` and `labels`.
5. Run `bun run dev` and review the landing page header. If it appears correctly, you're ready to go.
6. Optionally, I recommend using the VSCode extension [i18n Ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Lokalise.i18n-ally), which makes machine translation easy.
7. Also optionally, install [specific CSpell language](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts#language-dictionaries) for full support of this language in VSCode (when using the "[Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)" extension). If the language is not available, try to find a word dictionary file on the web or make a new one (see CSpell docs).

By the way, **if the country flag is not displayed**: open `src/localization-main.tsx`, go to *LocaleFlagIcon* and add the `else if`. Please visit the [flag-icons library website](https://flagicons.lipis.dev/) to see the code for the missing icon. The example for *zh-cn* will be: `} else if (baseLocale === "zh") { return <span aria-hidden="true" className="fi fi-cn mr-2" />; }`

Please be aware that both the "i18n Ally" VSCode extension and manual systems like "Google Translate" may incorrectly translate variables. If you encounter an error like this:
Original Message: 'The intl string context variable "类别" was not provided to the string "购买最好的{类别}"'.
This error occurs because I have {类别}, but it should be {category}. To verify the correct variable, refer to the en-us.json file.Certainly! So the correct version for this specific case will be:

```json
{
  "categories": {
    "buyFromCategories": "从最好的商店购买 {category}",
    "buyProducts": "购买 ${category} 类别的产品",
    "buyTheBest": "购买最好的 {category}"
  }
}
```

**Currently supported locales (you can add the own manually):**

- de, en, es, ms, fr, hi, it, pl, tr, uk, zh.
- de-DE, en-US, es-ES, ms-MY, fr-FR, hi-IN, it-IT, pl-PL, tr-TR, uk-UA, zh-CN.
