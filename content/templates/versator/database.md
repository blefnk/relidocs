description: This is the database of Versator.

Versator uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team) for database management. By default, the project uses [Neon](https://neon.tech) (Serverless) with [PostgreSQL](https://neon.tech/docs/postgresql/introduction) as the database provider. The project has already followed [Drizzle's guide](https://orm.drizzle.team/learn/tutorials/drizzle-with-neon) on how to set up Drizzle with Neon Postgres.

**August 4, 2024: Hot Update**:

If you use `neon` as your database provider, you no longer need `bun db:studio`; simply use Drizzle Studio on [Neon's website](https://neon.tech) ðŸŽ‰

For development databases without important data, you can use `bun db:push`. For production databases containing important data, it is recommended to use `bun db:generate` followed by `bun db:migrate`.

> Drizzle Kit lets you alter you database schema and rapidly move forward with a [bun db:push](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/overview#prototyping-with-db-push) command. Thatâ€™s very handy when you have remote databases like Neon, Planetscale or Turso. The 'push' command is ideal for quickly testing new schema designs or changes in a local development environment, allowing fast iterations without the overhead of managing migration files.

**Drizzle Team**: If you want to iterate quickly during local development or if your project doesnâ€™t require migration files, Drizzle offers a useful command called drizzle-kit push. **When do you need to use the â€˜pushâ€™ command?** **1.** During the prototyping and experimentation phase of your schema on a local environment. **2.** When you are utilizing an external provider that manages migrations and schema changes for you (e.g., PlanetScale). **3.** If you are comfortable modifying the database schema before your code changes can be deployed.

**Note**: NEXT_PUBLIC_DB_PROVIDER was removed in Versator v1.2.6. To switch the provider from Neon, modify `drizzle.config.ts`. To use MySQL or LibSQL providers, update the files inside `src/db`. An automatic switcher is coming in Versator version 1.3.x.

*The instructions below may be outdated, so please double-check them! I will fully update this README.md with the Versator 1.3.0 release.*

Versator is designed to effortlessly support both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. While PostgreSQL and [Neon](https://neon.tech) are the default configurations, switching to MySQL provided by [Railway](https://railway.app?referralCode=sATgpf) or [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com), or to PostgreSQL provided by [Railway](https://railway.app?referralCode=sATgpf) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/storage/postgres) is straightforward. Adjust the database configuration inside [drizzle.config.ts](./drizzle.config.ts) and the `src/db/*` files accordingly. Although Versator is optimized for these providers, other providers compatible with Drizzle and Auth.js (next-auth@beta/NextAuth.js) might also work with some additional setup. Full SQLite support is coming soon.

To set up the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file, refer to `.env.example`. Initiate a new database or propagate schema changes by executing the `bun db:push` command. This ensures that all changes made to the schema files in `src/db/*` are mirrored in the selected database provider.

For database migrations, use the `bun db:generate` command, review the `drizzle` folder to ensure everything is correct, and run the `bun db:migrate` command when ready. If necessary, use `bun db:drop` to manage reversals in a controlled way.

If you used Versator before v1.2.6, you may remove the `drizzle` folder inside the root directory. **Possible outdated information:** Do not manually delete files from the `drizzle` directory. Instead, use the [`bun db:drop` command](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/commands#drop-migration) if a migration needs to be reversed.

I ensure consistent database configuration by using the setup inside `drizzle.config.ts` and exporting configurations in `src/db/index.ts` and `src/db/schema/index.ts`. When selecting a database provider, comment out or remove unneeded providers in the `switch-case` of these files and remove related schema files as necessary. Additional adjustments in other files may also be required. An automatic switcher is coming soon in the Versator v1.3.0 release.

**Historical context**: In Versator v1.1.0, I aimed to provide simultaneous support for both MySQL and PostgreSQL for Drizzle ORM. In future releases, I plan to integrate Prisma ORM, making the project even more inclusive.
