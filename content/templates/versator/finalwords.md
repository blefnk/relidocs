This Next.js 15 starter — Versator — was crafted with love by [@blefnk Nazar Kornienko](https://github.com/blefnk) and the incredible [Bleverse OSS community](https://github.com/blefnk/versator/wiki/Project-Credits-&-Contributors). I'm deeply grateful for all your contributions and support for this project.

Happy coding! Embark on the coding adventure, learn, iterate, and most importantly – enjoy the process! Remember – this is a space of learning and experimentation. Dive in and savor the journey! 🚀🌌

Check out [our other free Next.js 15 starter](https://github.com/blefnk/reliverse). This monorepo provides the tech used in the current starter and adds: Turborepo/Turbopack, Prisma, Valibot, Lucia, Clerk, and much more, as I experimentally attempt to combine all vital and widely-used tech. Think of it as: Reliverse (WordPress) + Versator (WooCommerce) = 😍. So, start right now! Start today with Versator!
