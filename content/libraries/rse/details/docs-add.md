> **Note**: This command is currently in the development and may have some limitations. This README.md will be updated over time. Feedback is welcome!

[NPM](https://npmjs.com/@reliverse/rse) — [Discord](https://discord.gg/Pb8uKbwpsJ) — [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/blefnk) — [Docs](https://docs.reliverse.org/cli)

**@reliverse/rse** includes a **`rse add <something>`** subcommand—internally known as the "Manual Project Builder" or **Composer Mode**. This interactive tool helps you **create, customize, and integrate** new or existing projects with **Reliverse Addons** (i.e., integrations for APIs, auth, i18n, DB, frameworks, etc.).

The `rse add -g <something>` command simplifies installing global NPM packages and popular desktop applications directly from your command line. With a user-friendly, interactive prompt system, you can quickly select and install essential tools or specify exactly what you need in one go.

**Note**: Running `rse add` without a target (aka `<something>`) does the same thing as `rse init`.

`rse add rule <something>` — Browse and install AI IDE rules for rse, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, and more — official and community-sourced. Powered by smart caching and auto-conversion to `.mdc` format when needed.

## Features

- 🏗️ **Project Creation**  
  Automatically generates a new rse project and minimal config, if your current directory is empty.

- 🔌 **Addons & Integrations**  
  Easily integrate popular tools like Next.js, React Native, Prisma, or i18n solutions in just a few steps.

- 📝 **Configurable & Re-runnable**  
  Edits are stored in `reliverse.jsonc` or `reliverse.ts`. You can rerun the manual builder to apply changes.

- ⚡ **Quick Setup**  
  Automates tasks like installing dependencies, updating templates, or setting up key config files.

## Terminology

- **Manual Project Builder** = `bun add` (without any params) = **Composer Mode**: Composer mode is perfect when you want full control over your stack, one step at a time — with an interactive CLI experience. Think of it as your project's composer, conductor, and toolbox — all in one.  
- **Integrations** = **Addons**

## Usage

Install or update **@reliverse/rse**:

```sh
bun i -g @reliverse/rse
rse update
```

Run the **add** command to open the manual builder:

```sh
rse add something
```

- If **your current directory is empty**, the builder will offer to **create** a new project.
- If you already have an existing project or multiple projects, you'll see a **project selector** to edit or create.

## Example Flow

Below is an overview of the prompts and menus you'll encounter.

### 1. Main Menu Prompt

```bash
│  > 🔬 Create/edit project manually
```

Selecting this opens Composer Mode to either create or configure a project.

### 2. Project Creation (If Directory Is Empty)

```bash
◆  rse Project Selection
│  Dir C:/B/L/cli/tests-runtime is empty
│  > Create new project
│  Exit
│
◆  How should I name your brand new project?
│  I've just generated a random name for you (press <Enter> to use it): extra-short
│
◆  What type of project are you creating?
│  Web app (Includes desktop and mobile apps)
│  > Library (Includes clis and extensions)
│
◆  Created new project "extra-short" with minimal rse config.
│  It's recommended to:
│    1. Edit the generated config files as needed.
│    2. Rerun the manual builder to apply changes.
```

### 3. Project Selection (If Directory Is Not Empty)

```bash
◆  rse Project Selection
│  Choose an existing project or create a new one.
│  > Edit: extra-short (C:/B/L/cli/tests-runtime/extra-short)
│  Create new project
│  Exit
```

### 4. Project Menu

```bash
◆  Manual Builder Mode
│  Select an action to perform
│  > ...OPTIONS
```
