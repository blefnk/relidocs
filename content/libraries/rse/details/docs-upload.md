**@reliverse/rse** offers a streamlined `upload` command for quickly uploading images (and other files) to your preferred hosting destination‚Äîperfect for sharing assets or storing them for AI-driven workflows.

## Features

- ‚ö° **Instant uploads**  
  Just point to a file or directory, and rse handles the rest.

- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Flexible destinations**  
  Customize upload endpoints in your config or environment variables.

- üñºÔ∏è **File-type detection**  
  Automatically identifies image formats (png, jpg, gif, etc.)‚Äîbut can handle other file types, too.

- ‚úÖ **Seamless CLI integration**  
  Works natively within [@reliverse/rse](https://npmjs.com/@reliverse/rse), keeping your workflow unified.

- ü§ñ **AI-powered**  
  rse AI uses this command to store your generated files by using `rse ai generate image`.

## Usage & Examples

**Usage**:

```bash
# Upload a single file using default provider
rse upload myfile.jpg

# Force Uploadcare
rse upload myfile.jpg -p uploadcare

# Multiple files
rse upload file1.jpg file2.pdf -p uploadthing

# Patterns (experimental)
rse upload path/to/image.jpg path/to/directory/**/*.{png,jpg,gif}
```

- Detects the file is an image and uploads it to your chosen provider.
- Returns a direct link to the hosted file.

- **Multiple File Upload**  

```sh
rse upload images/
```

- Recursively scans the `images` directory for supported file types.
- Uploads each file separately, logging the final URLs or statuses.

- **Custom Configuration**  
- Environment variables or a `reliverse.jsonc`/`reliverse.ts` file can specify custom hosting settings.
- Example:

```jsonc
// reliverse.jsonc
{
  "upload": {
    "destination": "customS3orCDN",
    "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

## Behind the Scenes

1. **File Detection**  
   The CLI checks if the path is a single file or directory.
2. **Upload Process**  
   - Gathers metadata (file type, size, etc.).
   - Sends data to the configured hosting endpoint.
3. **Result Logging**  
   - On success, prints the final hosted URL or location.
   - On failure, shows an error message with debug info.
