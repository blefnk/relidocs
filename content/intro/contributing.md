description: A best practices guide to contributing to Reliverse Community.
---

Reliverse is a community-driven open-source ecosystem. I welcome everyone to contribute to my projects. If you're interested in contributing to Reliverse, please follow these guidelines:

## Contributing

1. Fork any of my repositories.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Make your changes.
4. Submit a pull request.

We'll review your changes and merge them if they align with my project goals.

## Additional Recommendations

- I should try to keep the docs as up-to-date and as tiny as possible.
- When I need to describe something more deeply, I use Reliverse Docs.
